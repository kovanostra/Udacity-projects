## SUMMARY:

This is a bar plot of the 20 airports that had the highest minutes of delay, on average, for 7 - 13 January 2008. Hovering above the bars one can see the code of the airport (iata), the state whete it is located and some other statistics concerning delay times for that time period. It is notable that while maximum delay times are high, the median delays are very low (or non-existent in some cases). The data I used comes from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and can be downloaded from the following webpage: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html.
